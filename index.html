					<p class="description">Lions are the most sociable members of the cat family and can be found living in prides of up to 25 individuals. They are the largest African cat, and on a good hunting day, can consume 15% of their body weight. They also spend most of their day sleeping, sometimes up to 20 hours a day. </p>
